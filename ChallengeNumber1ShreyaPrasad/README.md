Description of UI: In this UI, I inserted an image and made it as 
background image instead of using it directly as background image
and enclosed it under a div. Over that I created a card inside which
 all the contents of the UI is present. I used flex property so 
that making the webpage responsive becomes easy. I created divs for 
making buttons instead of actual buttons as manipulating CSS with divs 
is easy. There are no dependencies used in this UI.
